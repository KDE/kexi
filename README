Building and running
--------------------

Calligra Suite is based on the KDE libraries ( http://www.kde.org ) which are
needed to run Calligra Suite.  Note that you don't have to actually run the
KDE desktop environment in order to use Calligra Suite.  Calligra Suite works fine
on any desktop or platform.

You will need kdesupport, kdelibs and kdebase/runtime
installed if you want to compile and run Calligra Suite. Installing kdepimlibs
gives more functionality.
For importing some external file formats or other plugins, you may
also need some other dependencies.  For more details on how to build
Calligra Suite from the sources, see:
