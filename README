KOffice is based on KDE libraries ( http://www.kde.org ) which are needed to
run KOffice.  It is important to make clear you don't have to actually run
the KDE desktop in order to use KOffice.
You need kdelibs, kdepimlibs and kdebase installed if you want to compile and run
KOffice.
See http://wiki.koffice.org/index.php?title=Build_KOffice

Developers:
===========

KOffice is created by Open Source programmers around the world. All developers
give their time/code to the community for everyone to benefit. The major reason
this is done is because those developers want to have a good office suite, and
they don't mind sharing it with you.

If you feel you found a bug or missing feature you can always contact the
developers of KOffice (via http://www.koffice.org ) or delve into the software
yourself.

The part that is shared between all KOffice applications can be found in the libs
directory. There classes like KoDocument can be found; these classes are
extended in the project directories.

Read the .h files in the respective directories for more info or read the online
API docs which you can find at http://www.koffice.org/developer/apidocmain.php
