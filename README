Koffice is based on KDE (www.kde.org) which is needed to run Koffice.
You need kdelibs and kdebase installed if you want to compile and 
run koffice. Look in the kdelibs sourcedir for the file COMPILING
for help. Also look at the website as there are many helpfiles 
available.

Koffice is a collection of office applications linked together by a
common basis. This common basis assures that all office application
can work together. You can, for instance, insert a spreadsheet in 
your thesis without leaving your document. Editing the spreadsheet
happens _inside_ your thesis.

The applications included in KOffice as of the release of KDE2 are:
- KWord
  Professional text editing 
- KSpread
  Progessional number cruncher/spreadsheet
- KPresenter
  Give presentations life
- KChart
  Creating graphics of your abstract data
- KIllustrator
  Vector graphics tool
- KOffice Workspace
  A combination of all of the above

Developers:
===========

KOffice is created by Open Source programmers around the world. All 
developers give there time/code to the community for everyone to
benefit. The major reason this is done is because those developers
want to have a good office suite, and they dont mind sharing that
with you.
If you feel you found a bug or missing feature you can always contact
the developers of koffice (via www.koffice.org) or delve into the
software yourself.

The part that is shared between all koffice applications can be found
in the lib directory. 
There classes like KoDocument can be found, these classes are extended
in the project directories.

Read the .h files in the respective directories for more info.


Document format:
================

All KOffice applications use files in the XML format. The XML format 
can be read with a text editor. The XML format itself is simply a set
of tags, where the application can define what these tags look like.
The definition of the document type is therefor different per 
koffice application (as you will hardly find a curved line in a kword 
document). The Docuemnt Type Definition can be found in every application
sourcedir in the dir 'dtd'

Also of interest is the lib/store/SPEC file


If you want to see more/fix bugs in this file, feel free to ask or add it 
yourself.
