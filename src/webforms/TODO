TODO file for Kexi Web forms daemon:
Tasks are listed from the most important to the least important:

 * Add another level of indirection with Server API (the one wrapping shttpd)
   by adding the Request object (wrapping GET/POST requests)
   - Investigate, at the moment there's a Request, but it's just a typedef to
   	 shttpd internal struct shttpd_arg, since shttpd_register_uri needs function pointers
   	 with shttpd_arg as argument I should find out a solution to not break things and carry
     out data. Maybe I can just create a utility namespace with functions accepting our
     shttpd_arg (alias Request) object. Ask jstaniek for the best solution.
 * Implement CRUD operations within table views
   	- Implement 'Create'
   	- Implement 'Read'
   	- Implement 'Update'
   	- Implement 'Delete'
 * Add a nifty 'Run SQL query' box
   	- Investigate the possibility to use AJAX and some sort of javascript-based autocomplete facility
 * Refine code inside views
 * Implement shortcut and connection file loading
 * Refine the whole code
