Hey Emacs, this is an -*- org -*- file!

      - Take inspiration from our competitors? :-)

* Post GSOC Tasks/Ideas
** TODO New webserver backend
   I'd like to see a new webserver backend. Using function pointers is not the
   best way to implement handlers.
   It should be most probably written using QtNetwork.
   It should be designed as a library, with multithreading support, to improve
   and encourage reuse.

   - Ideally this can be made using QtNetwork and QThread classes to create a
   Pure C++ multithreaded web server. The webserver should be developed as a library
   to improve code reuse.
