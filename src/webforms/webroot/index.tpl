<h3>Welcome to Kexi Web Forms</h3>
<p>
  Kexi Web Forms can export your database on the web. No matter if
  your users don't have Kexi installed, they'll only need a web browser.
  No matter if your users are on Windows, Linux, OSX.
  Kexi Web Forms is designed to be standard compliant, thus inter-operation
  with other Operating Systems is allowed. Kexi Web forms uses the powerful KexiDB
  library to perform queries on the database and it's developed by a group
  of careful programmers.

<!-- How-to -->
<h3>How to use this web interface</h3>
<p>
  On the left side, there's a list of the tables found in the database,
  By clicking on it the 'Read' view opens.
  On the right side there's a toolbox with 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons which
  can be used to edit or delete the selected row.
  At the top of the page there's a clickable text field which can be used
  to create new records.

<h3>The account manager</h3>
<p>
  At the moment we are experimenting a new account manager, the only user allowed
  to access /delete /update and /create is 'root'. Use the following credentials
  <pre>
  User name: root
  Password: root
  </pre>
