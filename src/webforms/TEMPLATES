Why there are much HTML tags in my code?
The answer is simple: google-ctemplate.
Google-ctemplate is not designed to have a full-featured templating language
it only has simple constructs and therefore we must keep stuff inside our code.
However, when I first looked for a C++ template engine I only found google-ctemplate.
If you want to suggest a better alternative let me know:

jstaniek (2008-06-09): 
We're limited to C++, and there apparently are no many templates.
There's http://reki.ru/products/ctpp/ but I am not sure it's worth switching.
