Why there are much HTML tags in my code?
The answer is simple: google-ctemplate.
Google-ctemplate is not designed to have a full-featured templating language
it only has simple constructs and therefore we must keep stuff inside our code.
However, when I first looked for a C++ template engine I only found google-ctemplate.
If you want to suggest a better alternative let me know:

We're limited to C++, and there apparently are no many templates: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_engine_(web)
There's http://reki.ru/products/ctpp/ but I am not sure it's worth switching.

Ok, that is nasty, just discovered that the official ctemplate packages put headers in /usr/include/google but
distributors (Fedora, at least) decided to put them in /usr/include/ctemplate.
A brutal work-around would be detecting if we have headers installed in /usr/include/google or in 
/usr/include/ctemplate and include them in our headers using a prefix'ed variable.
