This files is a list of known bugs, soon-to-be-fixed.
When a bug/regression disappears it means that it has been (hopefully) fixed

== KNOWN BUGS ==
- After opening a table for the first time, the kexi__users table is created and filled with two example
  accounts (root and guest) but none of the is usable
  WORK AROUND: restart kwebforms

== REGRESSIONS ==
- No field type icons
  Comment by Lorenzo Villani: this was impossible with the first version of getSchema in Database.cpp
    But now it should be easier to get icons back.

- Data is not %-decoded when inserted in the database
