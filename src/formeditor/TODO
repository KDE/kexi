^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  IMPORTANT  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**** New Features : ******
* KXmlGuiWindow support : Make an action editor + a toolbar editor (as in MozillaFirebird ?) + a menu editor
  (see Gambas and askk other devs if they already have done this)
* Automatically set label name to the text
* Create an event editor and manage signals/slots (EventBuffer ?)
	HOWEVER, SIGNAL/SLOT ISSUES (js):
	1. signals/slots mechanism is hard to use for average folks
	2. it may be easily simplified to avoid confusing them
	3. TrollTech would try to get influence on the Kexi Project
	  because of violating their licenses, if we'd like to expose
		all their technologies so plainly
	  (at least commercial) license mentions that there cannot be
	  a project that is a replacement of the Qt developed out of the Qt)
	4. It wouldn't hurt to ask them, as well.
* Add many other widgets :-)
* Create db-aware widget factory
