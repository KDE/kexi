^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  IMPORTANT  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**** New Features : ******
* When double-clicking on a QLabel or a QLabel (others ?), the widget should be inline-editable (also on creation)
* Create an event editor and manage signals/slots (EventBuffer ?)
	HOWEVER, SIGNAL/SLOT ISSUES (js):
	1. signals/slots mechanism is hard to use for average folks
	2. it may be easily simplified to avoid confusing them
	3. TrollTech would try to get influence on the Kexi Project
	  because of violating their licenses, if we'd like to expose
		all their technologies so plainly
	  (at least commercial) license mentions that there cannot be
	  a project that is a replacement of the Qt developed out of the Qt)
	4. It wouldn't hurt to ask them, as well.
* Add grid layout (if really needed)
* Add many other widgets :-)
* Create db-aware widget factory

****** Bugfixes/Changes : *****
* Remove all these " Q*** " names
* Add a grouping ability to Widget
* Make actions toggable (with KRadioAction)
