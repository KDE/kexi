^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  IMPORTANT  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**** New Features : ******
* Add support for layouts and special container (HBox, VBox ...) and spacers

* Create an event editor and manage signals/slots (EventBuffer ?)
	HOWEVER, SIGNAL/SLOT ISSUES (js):
	1. signals/slots mechanism is hard to use for average folks
	2. it may be easily simplified to avoid confusing them
	3. TrollTech would try to get influence on the Kexi Project 
	  because of violating their licenses, if we'd like to expose 
		all their technologies so plainly
	  (at least commercial) license mentions that there cannot be 
	  a project that is a replacement of the Qt developed out of the Qt)
	4. It wouldn't hurt to ask them, as well.

* Form previewing stuff (see KUIViewer)
* Add many other widgets :-)
* Create db-aware widget factory

****** Bugfixes/Changes : *****

* Make FormManager independant of the parent container (ie no longer depends on QWorkspace)
* Add a classname and filename member into Form
* Fix pixmaps in Property Editor
