# Compile python plugin only if python is installed. Kross itself doesn't 
# care of it cause it doesn't depend directly on the python plugin. Kross
# determinates at runtime if it's avaiable and if that's the case it just
# uses the plugin. So, we are able to don't compile the python plugin now
# and at a later stage once we like to use it, just compile+install the
# python plugin and let Kross use it without the need to recompiling whole
# Kross. So, for packagers it's recommed to move the python plugin into
# an own package that could be optional installed.
