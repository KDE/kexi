dear log, it's the 2002-09-09 02:25 or 2002-09-08 17:25 (GMT -8)

Here is the minimal functionality for the first release 0.0.1 (historic moment)
order by priority

1.	Back end plug-in implementation for ANSI compliant engines.
	1.1.	Plug-in interface framework designed
	1.2		Minimal implementation specified
	1.3		Implemented for CQL and mySQL

2.	Schema creation interface implemented

3.	Best query tool on earth (intuitive gui, good sql-translation)
	N.B., not all functionality implemented for 0.0.1.  No compromise on
	interface quality; if necessary compromise by reducing supported features.

4.	xml import/export features

5.	Usable report generator (kugar).  The interface for #3 is a building
	block for #4, as every report is associated with a query.

6.	Form generation and use (lowest priority).  Since schema creation is in
	a sense a subset of form generation, code from #2 should be reused in #5.
