//! Interface for main Table Designer's commands
/*! This interface has been specified to enable invoking Table Designer's commands
 at application's level. This is used in the "altertable" test suite, available in
 kexi/tests/altertable Kexi source code directory.
 KexiTableDesignerInterface is implemented by KexiTableDesignerView, so it's enough
 to use dynamic_cast:
 \code
 KexiWindow *window = KexiMainWindow::self()->currentWindow();
 if (window) {
   KexiTableDesignerInterface* designerIface
     = dynamic_cast<KexiTableDesignerInterface*>( window->selectedView() );
   if (designerIface) {
     //for example, delete row #3
     designerIface->deleteRow( 3, true );
   }
 }
 \endcode
 Methods of KexiTableDesignerInterface are also used by classes of KexiTableDesignerCommands
 namespace (KCommand derivatives) for implementing commands execution and unexecution.

 All the methods contain addCommand argument. Set if to true to get the command added
 to the undo/redo buffer, what will look like real user's action. This is also needed
 to poperly generate arguments for committing the "alter table" operation.
