 KexiView has 'dirty' flag to indicate that view's data has changed.
 This flag's state is reused by KexiWindow object that contain the view.
 KexiView objects can be also nested, using addChildView(): any actions and 'dirty' flag
 are transmited to parent view in this case.

 KexiView objects are usually allocated within KexiWindow objects by implementing
 KexiPart::createView() method. See query or table part code for examples.

 KexiView object can be also allocated without attaching it KexiWindow,
 especially within dock window. see KexiMainWindow::initNavigator() to see example
 how KexiBrowser does this.
