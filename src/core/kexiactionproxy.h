//! Abstract helper class used to connect shared actions from outside of shared-action-aware object.
/*! Methods like KexiActionProxy::plugSharedAction() are not public, but
 sometimes there's need for plugging an object that implements KexiActionProxy interface
 from outside.

 Reimplement KexiSharedActionConnector: do all needed connections in the constructor.

 For example, with KexiQueryDesignerSQLEditor class we're using KTextEdit
 (or KTextEditor::View) that's not shared-action-aware. So it's needed to conenct
 e.g. "edit_undo" shared action to undo() slot, and so on. It is impelmented in more
 generic way by implementing KTextEdit_SharedActionConnector class,
 so the conenction can be reused many times by just allocating KTextEdit_SharedActionConnector
 object for any KTextEditor when required (not only within KexiQueryDesignerSQLEditor).
