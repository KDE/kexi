//! Application-wide buffer for local BLOB data like pixmaps.
/*! For now only pixmaps are supported
 @todo support any KPart-compatible objects and more...

 Use this class by acessing to its singleton: KexiBLOBBuffer::self().

 This class is used for buffering BLOB data,
 to avoid duplicating object's data in memory and a need for loading (decoding)
 the same object many times.
 The data is always local, what means database storage is not employed here.

 Each BLOB instance is identified by an unsigned integer number (Id_t type),
 uniquely generated on BLOB loading. Each BLOB can have assigned source url
 it has been loaded from (the url can be empty though, e.g. for data coming from clipboard).

 References to KexiBLOBBuffer are counted, so when last reference is lost, data is freed
 and the integer identifier is no longer pointing any valid data.
 KexiBLOBBuffer::Handle is value-based class that describes handle based in an identifier.
 Objects of this class are obtained e.g. from insertPixmap() method.

 There are two kinds of identifiers:
 - integers assigned for BLOBs already saved to a db backend,
    when KexiBLOBBuffer::Handle::stored() is true
 - temporary integers assigned for new BLOBs not yet saved to a db backend,
    when KexiBLOBBuffer::Handle::stored() is false
 KexiBLOBBuffer::Handle::setStoredWidthID() can be used to switch from unstored to stored state.
 Among others, the state has effect on saving forms: only unstored BLOBs will be saved back
 to the database; when a BLOB needs to be removed, only it will be physically removed only if it was stored.

 KexiBLOBBuffer is also useful for two more reasons:
 - Property editor's item for "image" property displays a preview of pixmap contents.
   Without buffering, it would be needed to load pixmap data again: what if the file
   it is loaded from is located remote and connection is slow? Memory would be also unnecessary doubled.
 - Undo/Redo framework requires to store previous property values. Having a reference defined
   by a single interger, memory can be handled more effectively.

 Example use cases:
 A large pixmap file "abc.jpg" is loaded as QByteArray <b>once</b> and buffered:
 integer identifier is returned.
 Then, multiple image widgets are using "abc.jpg" for displaying.
 Duplicating an image widget means only duplicating it's properties
 like position and BLOB's id: BLOB itself (data of "abc.jpg") is not duplicated.
 Creating a new image widget and assiging the same "abc.jpg" pixmap, means only
 referencing KexiBLOBBuffer using the same identifier.
