/*!
  Plugins create windows (KexiWindow) for a given type of object.

  Notes for plugins implementors:  This class supports InternalPropertyMap interface,
  so supported internal properties affecting its behaviour are:
  - newObjectsAreDirty: True if newly created, unsaved objects are dirty. False by default.
  - instanceName: base i18n'd name of objects created by a plugin, e.g. "table",
    see instanceName().
  - instanceCaption: i18n'd instance name usable for displaying in gui as object's caption,
    e.g. "Table", see instanceCaption()
  - instanceToolTip: i18n'd tool tip for "Create" action for a given part, e.g. "Create new table"
  - instanceWhatsThis: i18n'd "What's This" text for "Create" action for a given part,
    e.g. "Creates new table."
  - textViewModeCaption: custum action text replacing standard "Text View" text.
    Used in for query's "SQL View".
  In general: a whole set of i18n'd action names, initialised on KexiPart::Part subclass ctor.
  The names are useful because the same action can have other name for each part
  E.g. "New table" vs "New query" can have different forms for some languages.
  So this is a flexible way for customizing translatable strings.
