Main goals:
	*) easy extendability
	*) common look and feel for common tasks

**************************

Workflow importing : 
Step 1:
	a)
		Project->Import
			-> File
			-> Connection 
		==> All  types

	b)
		RMB item group in navigator->Import
			-> File
			-> Connection
		==> Only type of item group

------
File based:
Step 2:
	*) Lookup of any ImportSource plugin capable handling any of the possible types
        *) Filling of mime filter list on file dialog page
	*) Loading of plugin previously looked up for handing specified file
Step 3:
	*) Showing user all possible imports, eg all tables from a database
	*) Allowing source specific configuration, eg range selection in a kspread document
Step 4:
	*) loading import GUI plugin for destination kexi mimetype 
	*) Allow the user to choose how to import
			eg for tables:  import new table,
					append data to an existing table
						column remapping, renaming, ...
Step 5:
	*) doing import
		tables	: handing the chosen configuration over to PiggZ's kexidb-import architecture
		*	: GUI plugin is responsible for importing directly or loading an additional, NON visual plugin
Step 6:
	*) DONE
