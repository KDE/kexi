Assumptions
1. Now, I dont think about yet about features like data editing, sorting etc. 
  so, I try to forget about KexiTableList, until sorting will be readded.

2. I will try to reimpl. KexiTableView to accept (reuse) raw data offered internally by KexiDB::Cursor:
   const char ** recordData() const;
  This is easy at least for buffered read-only data. So, we also consider that cursor used as datasource
  is buffered.
  It would be way more offective than using soooo many allocations and classes with KexiTableItem ;
  btw, KexiTableItem is oversized: KexiTableView  pointer is stored with each KexiTableItem :)

result: for 1st step I keep KexiTableItem with some changes, code polishing
-	KexiTableItem is internal class so accessors will be removed; 
  shortly speaking - KexiTableItem is just a data structure
