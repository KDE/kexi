Kexi Final Mode Design
----------------------

1. Questions / Proposals

a) Do we need to store information about needed plugins? 
  The proposal: it's enough as is: needed plugin is checked on object loading.

b) Instead having redundant kexi__final, we can easily 
   use kexi__db with for the same purpose?

c) More than one startup item would be useful.
  The proposal: introduce property "startup_items" with a value of ordered 
	int-list of IDs: "32,543,324,532". This is also probably better than a list of names?

d) startup-related property (for kexi__db): 
  - "startup_mode", value: "0"==Design Mode, "1"==Final Mode
    (default satartup mode; can be overriden by --final-mode and --design-mode)
    "0" is the default
