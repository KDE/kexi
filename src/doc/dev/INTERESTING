[SQL Translator and Text RecordParser]

from README:
	SQL::Translator is a group of Perl modules that converts
	vendor-specific SQL table definitions into other formats, such as
	other vendor-specific SQL, ER diagrams, documentation (POD and HTML),
	XML, and Class::DBI classes.  The main focus of SQL::Translator is
	SQL, but parsers exist for other structured data formats, including
	Excel spreadsheets and arbitrarily delimited text files.  Through the
	separation of the code into parsers and producers with an object model
	in between, it's possible to combine any parser with any producer, to
	plug in custom parsers or producers, or to manipulate the parsed data
	via the built-in object model.  Presently only the definition parts of
	SQL are handled (CREATE, ALTER), not the manipulation of data (INSERT,
	UPDATE, DELETE).
