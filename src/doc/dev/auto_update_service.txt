OOPL-only: Create Update Service using kdecore/KMD5 and bzip2 lib. This would be used to automatic
updates for QKW and Kexi packages at the end-user side. Two options: 
- offline update from local archives
- online update from the company ftp resources
Benefits: 
- Updating would not longer require uninstal+install scheme.
- Settings could be stored safer between updates.
- User could be notified about new features and fixes installed.
- User could add/remove components.
- Everything using consistent gui on all platforms.
- 'Batch/net installation' options for enterprises.
- Smart 'Fix installation' option.
- Possibility of collecting user settings and infos about installations. These can optionally transferred 
to developers with a bug report to help find a bug context.
- This is a step for making KDE apps packages distribution-neutral on Linux.
Notes:
- The Service guis and backend should be build from two parts: 
  - First: qt-only that is used to initialize the process and check the system, independently 
		from existing KDE sybsystem. 
	- Second: used when we already know we already have a working KDE subsystem. This part can use 
		KConfig, KLibLoader, etc. to change the KDE settings.
- To be able to do this, KDE needs get more guidelines for distributors of its binaries.
- To be usable for commercial use, there should be one packaging system for KDE 
	(maybe on top of tgz/rpm/deb/win32/mac?), "Meta Packaging".
