Type: defined/undefined

(available in Tools>Migration menu) will be disabled; else: support will 
be enabled.

* KEXI_USE_GRADIENT_WIDGET
Type: defined/undefined
Default: undefined
Description: If defined, KexiGradientWidget is used as form's background. 
Currently disabled due to problems with performance and child widget's palettes.

* KEXI_NO_SUBFORM
Type: defined/undefined, temporary
Default: defined
Description: If defined, subform widget will not be available

* KEXI_NO_AUTOFIELD_WIDGET
Type: defined/undefined, temporary

* CUSTOM_VERSION
Type: defined/undefined
Default: undefined
Description: Defined means Kexi version compiled for standalone distribution 
with some minor vendor-specific tweaks. Used for OOPL version.

* KEXI_DEBUG_GUI
Type: defined/undefined
Default: defined (but should be undefined for final releases)
Description: If defined, showInternalDebugger=true (in [General] group) 
can be specified to display KexiDB Debugger. 
In the future the window will be probably used for debugging other features
like scripts or macros. This option is useful for Kexi Developers.

Also shows additional "Show Form UI Code" action in form's design mode. 
This is useful for debugging: after executing the action, 
a dialog with current (after changes) and original form's 
GUI XML code will be presented in a tabbed dialog, so you can compare what changed 
and look for possible problems. The "current" XML code will be saved when "save" 
action is executed. TODO: it will be merged with Internal Debuger window.

Type: defined/undefined
Default: defined
