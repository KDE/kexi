compiled and used for scripting.

(available in Tools>Migration menu) will be disabled; else: support will 
be enabled.

Type: defined/undefined
Default: defined (but should be undefined for final releases)
Description: If defined, showInternalDebugger=true (in [General] group)

In the future the window will be probably used for debugging other features
like scripts or macros. This option is useful for Kexi Developers.

Also shows additional "Show Form UI Code" action in form's design mode. 
This is useful for debugging: after executing the action, 
a dialog with current (after changes) and original form's 
GUI XML code will be presented in a tabbed dialog, so you can compare what changed 
and look for possible problems. The "current" XML code will be saved when "save" 
action is executed. TODO: it will be merged with Internal Debuger window.

Type: defined/undefined
