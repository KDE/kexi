PROPOSAL: Generic Guidlines For Kexi Development

Idea 1
Add tests for command line-only operations using kexiDB library.
These tests can be later turned to command line options for Kexi what will allow non 
GUI operations o databases/projects.

Idea 2
Look at QSQL module from QT. E.g. there is efficient cursor feature (it works quite good with mysql).
We have KexiDBRecordSet instead, but this is just the same thing.
In fact many KexiDB features are compatible with QSQL.
Focus on:
- avoid loading all result data to client memory (fetch some records instead)
- avoid blocking operations (do asynchronously as many things as possible)
- avoid memory copying (at low level try to store original char* data instead of QString,
  convert to QString only on data displaying)

Idea 3
Directories layout:
dialogs/
+-altertable/
+-datatable/
+-queryeditor/
+-sqleditor

widgets/
+-tableview/
+-datatableview/

Idea 4
Classes naming guidelines:
'Dialog' suffix for all classes
