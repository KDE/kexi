I. Over MS Access

1. Data Entry
1.1. Autonumber fields
Autonumber fields are editable. On a new record inserting, you can skip entering a value in autonumber field but you can also enter any (unique) value on your own (unavailable in MSA). For existing records, you can also change the number in the field (unavailable in MSA).

Automatically generated values for autonumber fields are only generated on new row inserting. If you cancel row inserting, no value will be generated. This allows you to keep counting consistent. In MSA autonumber's counter (sequence) is increased just when you start entering data of a new record.


2. Data presentation
2.1. Tabular data view
Sorting by selected column is also available by simply clicking on the column.
