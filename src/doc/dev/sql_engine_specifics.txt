SQL Engines - Specifics
-----------------------

This document lists specifics among SQL engines. We need to remember about them when implementing features of KexiDB and designing KEXISQL.

Legend: + == works, - == doesn't work, ? == not tested yet

== 1. Ordering by computed column ==
Examples: select rand() from T order by 1;
          select 1 from T order by 1; 
MySQL: +
SQLite: -
PostgreSQL: ?

== 2. Using more than just "*" in the column list ==
Example: select *, 1 from T;
MySQL: -
SQLite: +
PostgreSQL: ?

Notes: select T.*, 1 from T; works everywhere
