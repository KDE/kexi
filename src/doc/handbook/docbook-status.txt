HTML view of the Manual:

The chapter numbers in section headings here refer to
the Chapters in the HTML manual at
  http://iidea.pl/~js/kexi/manual/en/

The original Polish version can be found here:
http://iidea.pl/~js/kexi/manual/pl/html/contents.html

Icons and polish screenshots can be found here:
http://www.iidea.pl/~js/kexi/manual/en/kexi-docs-03.zip

Chapter numbers in each descriptions refers to docbook version.

Chapter 1:
Has moved to Appendix A.
Needs writing.


Chapter 2:
Largely irrelevant marketing.

Useful parts are now in Chapter 1
(some bits missing - I'll sort them).

Last Section (Different datatypes) is now moved to Appendix B.
(There are some discrepancies between HTML and reality, take 
care when editting)

Chapter 4:
Has become Chapter 2.

Chapter 8:
Has become Chapter 3.

Docbook version:

The chapter numbers here refer to the Docbooked manual.

The names refer to the person working on that part of the manual.
