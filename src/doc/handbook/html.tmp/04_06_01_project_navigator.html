<H3>4.6.1. Project Navigator pane</H3>
<p>
Project Navigator pane is one of the most frequently used elements of the Kexi main window.
The pane contains a list of all objects created within the currently opened Kexi database project. The objects are splitted into groups: tables, queries, forms.
<br>
</p>
<a name="mini_toolbar"></a>
<p>
Project Navigator pane also contains a <b>small toolbar for most frequently used commands</b> (from left to right): <em>Open selected object</em>, <em>Design selected object</em>, <em>Create a new object</em>, and <em>Delete selected object</em>.

For each object on the list context menu is available using the &RMB;. For example, this is context menu for <em>persons</em> table:

Commands of this menu is documented in <a href="aa_05_00_menu.html#nav_panel_menu">Appendix A.10<!-- TODO (js) APPENDIX number --></a>. 
<p>
See also a list of available shortcuts in <a href="ab_00_00_shortcuts.html#nav_panel">Appendix B.2. Project Navigator pane<!-- TODO (js) APPENDIX number --></a> .
</p>

<p>
Double clicking with &LMB; on the object's name on the list allows to open the object in Data View. If the object's window was alread opened, the action just activates the window without switching it's view mode.
</p>
<p>
Note that your operating system can be set up to handle single clicks instead of double clicks. In this case it is enough to single click on the object name to open it's window.
<!-- TODO (js) but then how to select an object without opening it? -->
