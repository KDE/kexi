<H4>Notes</H4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Note about databse files accessed remotely.</b> You may want to open a database file that is located on a remote source (e.g. an web or FTP server or MS Windows share). K Desktop Environment allows you to open files from remote sources directly in applications and saving changes back to the source, but this is not the case with database files. By clicking on a database file located on a remote source, you will cause a download the file to a temporary directory on your computer and all eventual your changes will be made to this local file. The remote original of the file will remain unchanged after you close Kexi, so it's recommended to copy (download) the file to your computer first, then open the file and copy it back to remove source if you want to make it up to date.</p>

</ul>
