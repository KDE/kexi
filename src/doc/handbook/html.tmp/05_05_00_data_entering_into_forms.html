<H3>5.5. Entering data using forms</H3>
<p>
Data entering and editing is usually database application user's task, not developer's. In practice it is desirable to check the form in terms of valid data entry, and see whether the form works as expected.
</p>
<p>
To test your form, switch to its data view. A single database row (record) of data will be displayed and a text cursor will be set inside the first data field. You can move between fields using &RMB; or <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> keys. While editing, there will be <img src="icons/button_tableview_editrow.png" class="icon"> pencil icon visible near the record navigator. After entering row's (record) data you can press <kbd>Shift+Enter</kbd> keys or <img src="icons/button_ok.png" class="icon"> toolbar button to accept changes made to the current row. Clicking <img src="icons/button_cancel.png" class="icon"> toolbar button discards changes made to the current row and restores contents of the data fields. You can use <img src="icons/navigator_next.png" class="icon"> record navigator's button to move to a new row. All the navigator's functions are also available in similar way as in the data table view<!-- TODO link -->.
