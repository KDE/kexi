<H2>1.3. Database design</H2>

<p>
Database design needs careful planning. Note that <em>Contacts</em> table redesign proposed in this section 1.2 can generate problems when the table is filled with data. For exampe, renaming a field is a simple task, but splitting <em>Address</em> field into two separate fields requires careful and tedious work. 
</p>
<p>
To avoid such situations, <b>rethink your database project</b> before you create it in your computer, and before you and others will start to use it. Thus, by investing some time initially, you will most probably save your time on everyday use.
