<H2>4.1. Project files</H2>
<p>Many applications such as OpenOffice.org or Microsoft Excel create files which are called <em>documents</em>. Kexi also creates files but we will call them <em>Kexi projects</em> or </em>Kexi database files</em>. 
</p>

<H4>Notes</H4>
<ul>
<li>Kexi database can also be stored on database servers. THis is why, to avoid ambiguity, we talked above about <em>Kexi database files</em> and not <em>Kexi database</em>. The latter will be used however if the way you store the database is irrelevant.</li>
</ul>
