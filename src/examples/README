Example Kexi database files
---------------------------

1. Introduction

This directory contains example Kexi database files in SQLite 3.1 format,
distributed with Kexi source package.


2. Files

Simple_Database.kexi - simple database described in the Kexi Handbook


3. Note for developers: generated files

If you are using Kexi source code obtained from KDE Subversion repository,
you can see .kexi.sql files here instead of .kexi files. This make it easier
to track changes in the Subversion repository.

Each .kexi file is generated out of the original .kexi.sql file by running 
build_kexi_files.sh script. 
Makefile is also provided, so you can just run make (or unsermake) to create 
.kexi files.

You can run update_sql_files.sh script if you have changed .kexi file using 
Kexi program and want to update the related .kexi.sql file before checking it 
into the Subversion repository.
