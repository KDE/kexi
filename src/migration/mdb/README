This is MDB file migration driver for KEXI. It can be used to convert simple MS Access
databases into native Kexi databases.

MDB files are the native database format of MS Access (and also some other MS applications).

Features:
- only import
- only tables are currently imported (no queries, forms, reports, etc.)
- imports all data types, including binary and memo
- imports primary keys
- imports data (records)

mdbtools library is used internally (https://github.com/brianb/mdbtools). To facilitate access to
the newest possible mdbtools version regardless of operating system KEXI runs on, mdbtools' code has
been imported to src/migration/mdb/3rdparty/mdbtools directory of KEXI. Only needed source files
have been copied, that is command line tools and GUI code is not included. This is not meant to be
a fork though, improvements are contributed back to the main project.
