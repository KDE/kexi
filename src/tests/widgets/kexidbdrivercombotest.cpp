   This is an example of the KexiDBDriverComboBox class, used to
   allow the user to pick a database driver.

   When run it shows two comboboxes. The top one allows the user to
   pick any database driver. The second allows the user to pick
   any of the drivers for database servers (i.e. it does not include
   file based drivers).
