---------- TOPIC000: GENERAL --------------
-- OK001: the same field used in two columns
select id, id from persons;

---------- TOPIC100: ALIASES --------------
-- OK101: aliases for columns
select id myid from persons;
-- OK102: aliases for tables
select id from persons p;
-- ER101: there's no "persons" table in this query (alias "p" covers it)
select persons.id from persons p;
-- OK102: alias "p" for table "persons" is used
select p.id from persons p;
-- OK103: multiple aliases for the same table
select persons.id from persons, persons p, persons p2
-- ER102: column "id" is defined in both tables (so "id" column is ambiguous)
select id from persons p, cars p;
-- ER103: alias "p" is used twice for tables and both have "id" column (so "p" column is ambiguous)
select p.id from persons p, cars p;
select p.* from persons p, cars p;
select persons.* from persons, cars persons;

-- TODO
-- OK104: like above, but it's ok, because we're not using fields from "p" tables
select 1 from persons p, cars p;
