Kexi README

Currently Kexi does not offer all create/open/save actions.
To play with the app (considering you have already kexi compiled and installed),
you need to:

1. Create test program:

% cd tests/newapi/
% make

(kexidbtest program will be created, not installed though)


2. Create database project file with example data:

% cd tests/newapi/
% ./kexidbtest sqlite tables db


3. Run kexi from command line:

% cd tests/newapi/
% kexi db

...or select "db" project file, using "open existing database" action on startup.
