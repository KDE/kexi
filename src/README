Introduction:
=============

Kexi is an integrated data management application. It can be used for 
creating database schemas, inserting data, performing queries, and 
processing data. Forms can be created to provide a custom interface to your 
data. All database objects - tables, queries and forms - are stored in the 
database, making it easy to share data and design.

Kexi is Free/Libre/Open-Source Software. As a real member of the KDE and 
KOffice projects, Kexi integrates fluently into both. It is designed to be 
fully usable also without KDE on Linux/Unix and MS Windows platforms.

Kexi is considered as a long awaited Open Source competitor for Microsoft 
Access, FileMaker and Oracle Forms. Its development is motivated by the 
lack of Rapid Application Development (RAD) tools for database systems that 
are sufficiently powerful, inexpensive, open standards driven and portable 
across many operating systems and hardware platforms.
