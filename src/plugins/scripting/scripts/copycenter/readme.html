<h1>Copy Center</h1>

<b>Version 1.2</b>

<p>Python script to copy data between database backends. The flexible 
plugin-architecture allows transparent copies between different backends.</p>

<ul>
<li>Read+write Kexi Databases. This includes all database backends supported by Kexi (like SQLite, MySQL or PostgreSQL).</li>
<li>Read+write QtSQL Databases. MySQL, PostgreSQL and UnixODBC are supported. There might even be more like Oracle in the commercial Qt version or 3rd party backends.</li>
<li>Runs embedded in Kexi (from the tools=>scripts menu) as well as independent of Kexi (use "krossrunner ~/.kde/share/apps/kexi/scripts/copycenter/CopyCenter.py" or python direct).</li>
<li>Depends only on PyQt. PyKDE is not used at all and Kross (included in KOffice 1.5) is optional.</li>
</ul>
