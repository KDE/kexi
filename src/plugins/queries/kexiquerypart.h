     * Closes objects that listenen to changes of the query schema @a query, i.e. use it.

     * These objects can be currently:
     * - lookup fields of tables
     * - queries using the query directly (as subqueries) or via lookup fields
     * - forms and reports that use the query directly as data source or via query.
     *
     * Scripts referencing the query programatically are not analyzed, so they can fail on next
     * execution.
     *
     * This method asks the user for approval if there is at least one object that listens for
     * changes of the schema (altering or removal). If there is no approval, returns
     * @c cancelled. On failure @c false is returned. If @a window is @c nullptr, @c true is
     * returned immediately because there is no window to care about.
     *
     * @note Unlike renaming tables, renaming queries just marks the previous query object one as
     * "obsolete" using KDbConnection::setQuerySchemaObsolete() and keeps the existing actual object
     * in memory so there is no risk of accessing deleted object by other objects.
     *
     * Special case: listener for the query @a query will be silently closed without asking for
     * confirmation. It is ignored when looking for objects that are "blocking" changes
     * of @a query. This exception is needed because the listener handles the data view's lifetime
     * and the data view should be reset silently without bothering the user.
