//! Design view of the Table Designer
/*! Contains a spreadsheet-like space for entering field definitions.
 Property editor is provided for altering field definitions.

 The view also supports Undo and Redo operations.
 These are connected to a factility creating a list of actions used
 by AlterTableHandler to perform required operation of altering the table.

 Altering itself is performed upon design saving (storeData()).
 Saving unstored designs just creates a new table.
 Saving changes made to empty (not filled with data) table is performed
 by physically deleting the previous table schema and recreating it
 TODO: this will be not quite when we have db relationships supported.

 Saving changes made to table containing data requires use of the AlterTableHandler
 functionality.
