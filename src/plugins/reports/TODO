Add plugins for koproperty for QPointF and QSizeF
Properly sync size/pos properties between the editor and the item
Make report entities (label/field etc) plugins, so its easier to add new ones ?
Maybe use flakes, or create a report 'shape' that can be embedded elsewhere
Add more math functions
Speed up background drawing - seems more dependant on gfx driver.... raster engine is faster than intel!
