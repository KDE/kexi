Add plugins for koproperty for QPointF and QSizeF
Properly sync size/pos properties between the editor and the item
Make koproperty faster
Make report entities (label/field etc) plugins, so its easier to add new ones
Maybe use flakes, or create a report 'shape' that can be embedded elsewhere
Add a 'Graph' entity (based on kchart)
Investigate using Kross for the scripting backend
Add 'on render' events to sections as they are rendered
Add functions for drawing (lines, circles, rectangles etc) from script that draw in a section
Add more math functions
Speed up background drawing
