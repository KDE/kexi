Kexi Scripting README
---------------------

The code in this directory implements some koffice/libs/kross
scripting plugins and provides that way Kexi functionality
to the Kross scripting framework. For more details see
http://www.kexi-project.org/wiki/wikiview/index.php?Scripting

/kexiapp/     Access to a running Kexi application. Kexi itself
              takes care of publishing it's KexiMainWindowImpl
              instance (see core/kexiscripting.*) and the
              kexiapp-plugin provides access to some of the
              applications functionality at runtime.

/kexidb/      Kross-plugin to provide nearly the whole KexiDB-
              framework to scripting interpreters. That way we
              are able to read/write from/to all by KexiDB
              supported databases.

/scripts/     Kexi-dependend scripts. This directory holds our
              in python written scripting extensions. Those
              extensions are just plugins for Kexi to extend
              it's functionality.
