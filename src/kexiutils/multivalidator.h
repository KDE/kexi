//! @short A validator groupping multiple QValidators
/*! MultiValidator behaves like normal KexiDB::Validator,
 but it allows to add define more than one different validator.
 Given validation is successful if every subvalidator accepted given value.

 - acceptsEmptyValue() is used globally here
   (no matter what is defined in subvalidators).

 - result of calling check() depends on value of check() returned by subvalidators:
   - Error is returned if at least one subvalidator returned Error;
   - Warning is returned if at least one subvalidator returned Warning and
     no validator returned error;
   - Ok is returned only if exactly all subvalidators returned Ok.
   - If there is no subvalidators defined, Error is always returned.
   - If a given subvalidator is not of class Validator but ust QValidator,
     it's assumed it's check() method returned Ok.

 - result of calling validate() (a method implemented for QValidator)
   depends on value of validate() returned by subvalidators:
   - Invalid is returned if at least one subvalidator returned Invalid
   - Intermediate is returned if at least one subvalidator returned Intermediate
   - Acceptable is returned if exactly all subvalidators returned Acceptable.
   - If there is no subvalidators defined, Invalid is always returned.

 If there are no subvalidators, the multi validator always accepts the input.
