/*! This helper class handles data changes of a single
 object implementing KexiDataAwareObjectInterface (e.g. KexiTableView) inside
 a KexiView container.

 It is currently used in KexiAlterTableDialog and KexiQueryDesignerGuiEditor,
 and may be used for similar purposes, when each KexiDataAwareObjectInterface's
 record can be associated with single KPropertySet object, and given
 KexiDataAwareObjectInterface object has to inform the world about currently
 selected record/property set.

 Following functionality is built-in:
 - auto-initializing after resetting of table view's data
 - destroying single property set that is associated with deleted record
 - inserting single property set that and associating it with new record
 - all property sets are cleared when view's data is cleared (using clear())
 - setting view's 'dirty' flag when needed
 - signalling via KexiView::propertySetSwitched() that current property
   set has changed (e.g. on moving to other record)
