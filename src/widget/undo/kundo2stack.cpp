    \class KUndo2Command
    \brief The KUndo2Command class is the base class of all commands stored on a KUndo2QStack.
    \since 4.2

    For an overview of Qt's Undo Framework, see the
    \l{Overview of Qt's Undo Framework}{overview document}.

    A KUndo2Command represents a single editing action on a document; for example,
    inserting or deleting a block of text in a text editor. KUndo2Command can apply
    a change to the document with redo() and undo the change with undo(). The
    implementations for these functions must be provided in a derived class.

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_gui_util_qundostack.cpp 0

    A KUndo2Command has an associated text(). This is a short string
    describing what the command does. It is used to update the text
    properties of the stack's undo and redo actions; see
    KUndo2QStack::createUndoAction() and KUndo2QStack::createRedoAction().

    KUndo2Command objects are owned by the stack they were pushed on.
    KUndo2QStack deletes a command if it has been undone and a new command is pushed. For example:

\snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_gui_util_qundostack.cpp 1

    In effect, when a command is pushed, it becomes the top-most command
    on the stack.

    To support command compression, KUndo2Command has an id() and the virtual function
    mergeWith(). These functions are used by KUndo2QStack::push().

    To support command macros, a KUndo2Command object can have any number of child
    commands. Undoing or redoing the parent command will cause the child
    commands to be undone or redone. A command can be assigned
    to a parent explicitly in the constructor. In this case, the command
    will be owned by the parent.

    The parent in this case is usually an empty command, in that it doesn't
    provide its own implementation of undo() and redo(). Instead, it uses
    the base implementations of these functions, which simply call undo() or
    redo() on all its children. The parent should, however, have a meaningful
    text().

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_gui_util_qundostack.cpp 2

    Another way to create macros is to use the convenience functions
    KUndo2QStack::beginMacro() and KUndo2QStack::endMacro().

/*!
    \class KUndo2QStack
    \brief The KUndo2QStack class is a stack of KUndo2Command objects.
    \since 4.2

    For an overview of Qt's Undo Framework, see the
    \l{Overview of Qt's Undo Framework}{overview document}.

    An undo stack maintains a stack of commands that have been applied to a
    document.

    New commands are pushed on the stack using push(). Commands can be
    undone and redone using undo() and redo(), or by triggering the
    actions returned by createUndoAction() and createRedoAction().

    KUndo2QStack keeps track of the \a current command. This is the command
    which will be executed by the next call to redo(). The index of this
    command is returned by index(). The state of the edited object can be
    rolled forward or back using setIndex(). If the top-most command on the
    stack has already been redone, index() is equal to count().

    KUndo2QStack provides support for undo and redo actions, command
    compression, command macros, and supports the concept of a
    \e{clean state}.

    \section1 Undo and Redo Actions

    KUndo2QStack provides convenient undo and redo QAction objects, which
    can be inserted into a menu or a toolbar. When commands are undone or
    redone, KUndo2QStack updates the text properties of these actions
    to reflect what change they will trigger. The actions are also disabled
    when no command is available for undo or redo. These actions
    are returned by KUndo2QStack::createUndoAction() and KUndo2QStack::createRedoAction().

    \section1 Command Compression and Macros

    Command compression is useful when several commands can be compressed
    into a single command that can be undone and redone in a single operation.
    For example, when a user types a character in a text editor, a new command
    is created. This command inserts the character into the document at the
    cursor position. However, it is more convenient for the user to be able
    to undo or redo typing of whole words, sentences, or paragraphs.
    Command compression allows these single-character commands to be merged
    into a single command which inserts or deletes sections of text.
    For more information, see KUndo2Command::mergeWith() and push().

    A command macro is a sequence of commands, all of which are undone and
    redone in one go. Command macros are created by giving a command a list
    of child commands.
    Undoing or redoing the parent command will cause the child commands to
    be undone or redone. Command macros may be created explicitly
    by specifying a parent in the KUndo2Command constructor, or by using the
    convenience functions beginMacro() and endMacro().

    Although command compression and macros appear to have the same effect to the
    user, they often have different uses in an application. Commands that
    perform small changes to a document may be usefully compressed if there is
    no need to individually record them, and if only larger changes are relevant
    to the user.
    However, for commands that need to be recorded individually, or those that
    cannot be compressed, it is useful to use macros to provide a more convenient
    user experience while maintaining a record of each command.

    \section1 Clean State

    KUndo2QStack supports the concept of a clean state. When the
    document is saved to disk, the stack can be marked as clean using
    setClean(). Whenever the stack returns to this state through undoing and
    redoing commands, it emits the signal cleanChanged(). This signal
    is also emitted when the stack leaves the clean state. This signal is
    usually used to enable and disable the save actions in the application,
    and to update the document's title to reflect that it contains unsaved
    changes.
