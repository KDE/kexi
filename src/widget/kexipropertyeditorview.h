//! @short The container (acts as a dock window) for KexiPropertyEditor.
/*! The widget displays KexiObjectInfoLabel on its top, to show user what
 object the properties belong to. Read KexiObjectInfoLabel documentation for
 the description what information is displayed.

 There are properties obtained from KexiMainWindow's current property set
 that help to customize displaying this information:
 - "this:classString property" of type string describes object's class name
 - "this:iconName" property of type string describes class name
 - "name" or "caption" property of type string describes object's name
 - "this:useCaptionAsObjectName" property of type boolean forces displaying "caption"
   property instead of "name" - this can be usable when we know that "caption" properties
   are available for a given type of objects (this is the case for Table Designer fields)
