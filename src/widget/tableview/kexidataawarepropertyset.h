/*! This helper class handles data changes of a single
 object implementing KexiDataAwareObjectInterface (e.g. KexiTableView) inside
 a KexiView container.

 It is currently used in KexiAlterTableDialog and KexiQueryDesignerGuiEditor,
 and may be used for similar purposes, when each KexiDataAwareObjectInterface's
 row can be associated with single KoProperty::Set object, and given
 KexiDataAwareObjectInterface object has to inform the world about currently
 selected row/property set.

 Following functionality is built-in:
 - auto-initializing after resetting of table view's data
 - destroying single property set that is associated with deleted row
 - inserting single property set that and associating it with new row
 - all property sets are cleared when view's data is cleared (using clear())
 - setting view's 'dirty' flag when needed
 - signalling via KexiView::propertySetSwitched() that current property
   set has changed (e.g. on moving to other row)
