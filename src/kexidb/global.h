\section Drivers

Drivers are loaded using DriverManager::driver(const QString& name).  The names
of drivers are given in their drivers .desktop file in the
X-Kexi-DriverName field.

KexiDB supports two kinds of databases: file-based and network-based databases.
The type of a driver is available from several places. The X-Kexi-DriverType
field in the driver's .desktop file, is read by the DriverManager and
available by calling DriverManager::driverInfo(const QString &name) and using
the Driver::Info#fileBased member from the result. Given a reference to a
Driver, its type can also be found directly using Driver::isFileDriver() const.

Each database backend driver consists of three main classes: a driver,
a connection and a cursor class, e.g SQLiteDriver, SQLiteConnection,
SQLiteCursor.

The driver classes subclass the Driver class.  They set Driver#m_typeNames,
which maps KexiDB's Field::Type on to the types supported by the database.  They also
provide functions for escaping strings and checking table names.  These may be
used, for example, on a database backend that uses the database name as a
filename.  In this case, it should be ensured that all the characters in the
database name are valid characters in a filename.

The connection classes subclass the Connection class, and include most of the
calls to the native database API.

The cursor classes subclass Cursor, and implement cursor functionality specific
to the database backend.
