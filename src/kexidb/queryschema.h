    /*! \return fully expanded list of fields.
     QuerySchema::fields() returns vector of fields used for the query columns,
     but in a case when there are asterisks defined for the query,
     it does not expand QueryAsterisk objects to field lists but return every
     asterisk as-is.
     This could be inconvenient when you need just a fully expanded list of fields,
     so this method does the work for you.

     If \a options is Unique, each field is returned in the vector only once
     (first found field is selected).
     Note however, that the same field can be returned more than once if it has attached
     a different alias.
     For example, let t be TABLE( a, b ) and let query be defined
     by "SELECT *, a AS alfa FROM t" statement. Both fieldsExpanded(Default)
     and fieldsExpanded(Unique) will return [ a, b, a (alfa) ] list.
     On the other hand, for query defined by "SELECT *, a FROM t" statement,
     fieldsExpanded(Default) will return [ a, b, a ] list while
     fieldsExpanded(Unique) will return [ a, b ] list.

     If \a options is WithInternalFields or WithInternalFieldsAndRowID,
     additional internal fields are also appended to the vector.

     If \a options is WithInternalFieldsAndRowID,
     one fake BigInteger column is appended to make space for ROWID column used
     by KexiDB::Cursor implementations. For example, let persons be TABLE( surname, city_id ),
     let city_number reference cities.is in TABLE cities( id, name ) and let query q be defined
     by "SELECT * FROM t" statement. If we want to display persons' city names instead of city_id's.
     To do this, cities.name has to be retrieved as well, so the following statement should be used:
     "SELECT * FROM persons, cities.name LEFT OUTER JOIN cities ON persons.city_id=cities.id".
     Thus, calling fieldsExpanded(WithInternalFieldsAndRowID) will return 4 elements instead of 2:
     persons.surname, persons.city_id, cities.name, {ROWID}. The {ROWID} item is the placeholder
     used for fetching ROWID by KexiDB cursors.

     By default, all fields are returned in the vector even
     if there are multiple occurrences of one or more (options == Default).

     Note: You should assign the resulted vector in your space - it will be shared
     and implicity copied on any modification.
     This method's result is cached by QuerySchema object.

     - If \a options is UnexpandedList, each QueryColumnInfo pointer is mapped to the index

       is mapped to the index within (unexpanded) list of columns that come from asterisks

     here - in this case the index is counted as a sum of size(e) + i (where "e" is
     the list of expanded fields and i is the column index within internal fields list).
     This feature is used eg. at the end of Connection::updateRow() where need indices of
     fields (including internal) to update all the values in memory.

     Example use: let t be table (int id, name text, surname text) and q be query
     defined by a statement "select * from t".

     - columnsOrder(ExpandedList) will return the following map: QueryColumnInfo(id)->0,
       QueryColumnInfo(name)->1, QueryColumnInfo(surname)->2.
     - columnsOrder(UnexpandedList) will return the following map: QueryColumnInfo(id)->0,
       QueryColumnInfo(name)->0, QueryColumnInfo(surname)->0 because the column
       list is not expanded. This way you can use the returned index to get Field*
       pointer using field(uint) method of FieldList superclass.
     - columnsOrder(UnexpandedListWithoutAsterisks) will return the following map:
       QueryColumnInfo(id)->0,
