//! @short Helper class performing interactive compacting (VACUUM) of the SQLite database
/*! Proved SQLite database filename in the constructor.
 Then execute run() should be executed.

 KProgressDialog will be displayed. Its progress bar will be updated whenever another
 table's data compacting is performed. User can click "Cancel" button in any time
 (except the final committing) to cancel the operation. In this case,
 it's guaranteed that the original file remains unchanged.

 This is possible because we rely on SQLite's VACUUM SQL command, which itself temporarily
 creates a copy of the original database file, and replaces the orginal with the new only
 on success.
