//! Provides database cursor functionality.
/*!
  Cursor can be defined in two ways:

  -# by passing QuerySchema object to Connection::executeQuery() or Connection::prepareQuery();
     then query is defined for in engine-independent way -- this is recommended usage

  -# by passing raw query statement string to Connection::executeQuery() or Connection::prepareQuery();
     then query may be defined for in engine-dependent way -- this is not recommended usage,
     but convenient when we can't or do not want to allocate QuerySchema object, while we
     know that the query statement is syntactically and logically ok in our context.

  You can move cursor to next record with moveNext() and move back with movePrev().
  The cursor is always positioned on record, not between records, with exception that
  ofter open() it is positioned before first record (if any) -- then bof() equals true,
  and can be positioned after the last record (if any) with moveNext() -- then eof() equals true,
  For example, if you have four records 1, 2, 3, 4, then after calling moveNext(),
  moveNext(), moveNext(), movePrev() you are going through records: 1, 2, 3, 2.

  Cursor can be buffered or unbuferred.
  Buffering in this class is not related to any SQL engine capatibilities for server-side cursors
  (eg. like 'DECLARE CURSOR' statement) - buffered data is at client (application) side.
  Any record retrieved in buffered cursor will be stored inside an internal buffer
  and reused when needed. Unbuffered cursor always requires one record fetching from
  db connection at every step done with moveNext(), movePrev(), etc.

  Notes:
  - Do not use delete operator for Cursor objects - this will fail; use Connection::deleteCursor()
  instead.
  - QuerySchema object is not owned by Cursor object that uses it.
