This directory stores the productsets.

When building Calligra a lot of different things are created and installed.
All these things are grouped into so-called products. Each product is defined in
the toplevel CMakeList.txt by a call of calligra_define_product, with the id of
the product as first parameter.
These product ids are used to generate cmake variables SHOULD_BUILD_${PRODUCT_ID}
which then are used to control if the things belonging to the product are build,
usually with
if(SHOULD_BUILD_SOME_PRODUCT_ID)
    [...]
endif(SHOULD_BUILD_SOME_PRODUCT_ID)
.
Dependencies of products on other products are also defined. Using this information
it is also ensured that if an internal dependency cannot be built due to missing
external dependencies, all depending products will also not built.

There can be also meta-products, which simply require a certain set of other
products but are never used directly to control what is build (e.g. WORDS).

At time of writing there are 4 predefined product sets, which you can all see in
this directory: ALL (default), DESKTOP, ACTIVE, CREATIVE.

You can add your own productset by adding a file in this directory and selecting
that productset when calling cmake:

The file must be named with the name of the productset in lowercase and have
the extension ".cmake". The content should be a cmake command that sets the
variable "CALLIGRA_SHOULD_BUILD_PRODUCTS" to the list of products the productset
should consist of.

For the possible products have a look at the list of product definitions in the
toplevel "CMakeLists.txt" file.


Example:

You want a productset "PUREWORDS". For that you add a file name "purewords.cmake"
into this directory, with the content:
--- 8< ---
set( CALLIGRA_SHOULD_BUILD_PRODUCTS
    WORDS
)
--- 8< ---

When calling cmake you use the string "PUREWORDS" as value for the parameter
"PRODUCTSET, like this:
    cmake -DPRODUCTSET=PUREWORDS [other parameters]
