This directory stores the productsets.

You can add your own productset by adding a file in this directory and selecting
that productset when calling cmake:

The file must be named with the name of the productset in lowercase and have
the extension ".cmake". The content should be a cmake command that sets the
variable "CALLIGRA_SHOULD_BUILD_PRODUCTS" to the list of products the productset
should consist of.

For the possible products have a look at the list of product definitions in the
toplevel "CMakeLists.txt" file.


Example:

You want a productset "PUREWORDS". For that you add a file name "purewords.cmake"
into this directory, with the content:
--- 8< ---
set( CALLIGRA_SHOULD_BUILD_PRODUCTS
    WORDS
)
--- 8< ---

When calling cmake you use the string "PUREWORDS" as value for the parameter
"PRODUCTSET, like this:
    cmake -DPRODUCTSET=PUREWORDS [other parameters]
